* Project Started (not really started this date, but this particular Visual Studio Solution was created on this date)

# 2018-01-03

* Changed up 'bitconverterExtensions' to 'bitwise' since BitConverter really ought to provide the features and functions I've written in, but BitConverter's a really stupid name.  Nothing's actually being converted.

* Added arrayExtensions.insertAt and arrayExtensions.removeAt

* Added stringExtensions.copyStringToString and copyStringToCharArray

* Added stringExtensions.textTrim.cs file containing several functions (trimLeft, trimRight, trimBoth, with each function providing overloads that accept either a string-to-trim or a charArray-to-trim)
